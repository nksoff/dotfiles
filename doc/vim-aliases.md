# vim aliases

This is the list of my aliases for standart actions (or simple ones). More aliases are added with plugins listed in [vimrc.plugins](https://github.com/nksoff/dotfiles/blob/master/files/vimrc.plugins).

`<leader>` is `,`.

`n`, `N`, `*`, `#`, `g*`, `g#` are aliased to be in the center of the screen.

`j`, `k` are aliased to move between sublines (wordwrapped).

Arrows are turned off (hell mode is on).


| Alias | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `//` | toggles highlighting of the strings found during last search |
| `<tab>` | switches to next tab (cyclic) |
| `<shift+tab>` | switches to previous tab (cyclic) |
| `Y` | yanks (copies) everything up to the end of the line |
| `:w!!` | saves file as root |
| `<leader>p` | toggles paste mode |
| `<leader>r` | redoes last undone action |

| `<leader>N` | toggles lines number (cyclic: none, absolute, relative) |

| `ss` | splits |
| `vv` | splits vertically |
